        <h3>Width and height</h3>
        <p>width is how long it is, and height is how tall the element are </br> it need a value afterward which describe the amount it will affect the element. 
        </br> one example are width: 100px; </p>

        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>Padding will increase the "air" inside of the element itself. making it expand </br> easily spotted if having an box 
        </br> by doing an padding: 10px; you will see that it will be 10 px on every side of the border, making it expand</p>

        <h3>border</h3>
        <p>Border will surround the element, creating a "wall" around it </br>also modified by border: 10px; creating how big it is</p>

        <h3>margin</h3>
        <p>Margin is the air outside the element and defines distance to other elements </br> one example is margin-bottom: 10px; as this will push the element under 10px away</p>

        <h3>Adjusting to fit the element to the picture</h3>
        <p>By this i mean: if originally having an width:200px; and height:80px; </br> then by adding additional modifiers as padding, border or margins will change the size and position </br>
        So if wanting to get it back to how it were, WITH the additional modifiers. </br> you will have to substract the added modifiers from the value you want to adjust. </br>
    wherever it is the width, height or both</p>
    </div>
