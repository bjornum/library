    <h1>CSS cheat or Help paper</h1>
    <div>
        <h1>Css tags</h1>

        <h2>Things to remember</h2>
        <p>the tag will always surround the "children" element as the parent. so elements outside the tag, wont be affected</p>

        <h2>colors</h2>
        <p>as the title say, will be color tags</p>
        <h3>colors</h3>
        <p>Can find the color you wanna use in 3 different ways, i will be using the color red in all of these </br>nr 1 is simply typing {color: red;}</br>
        nr 2 is by using the hex value (code of the color) {color: #FF0000;} </br> nr 3 is RGB (red green blue) value {color: rgb(255,0,0)}</p>

        <h3>Background-color</h3>
        <p>It is written under the <style>  </style> tag in the <head>   </head> part </br> If wanting the entire page in a certain color. Simply type the id or class of that code</br>
    like this value>
        body {
            background-color: cyan;
        }
    /value> (pretending i called it body in css) </br> if wanting to surround certain elements, then do the same. other than using the code by the parent of the element</p>

        <h2>Width, Height, Padding, Borders, Margin and how to adjust after adding these</h2>
        <h3>Width and height</h3>
        <p>width is how long it is, and height is how tall the element are </br> it need a value afterward which describe the amount it will affect the element. 
        </br> one example are width: 100px; </p>

        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>Padding will increase the "air" inside of the element itself. making it expand </br> easily spotted if having an box 
        </br> by doing an padding: 10px; you will see that it will be 10 px on every side of the border, making it expand</p>

        <h3>border</h3>
        <p>Border will surround the element, creating a "wall" around it </br>also modified by border: 10px; creating how big it is</p>

        <h3>margin</h3>
        <p>Margin is the air outside the element and defines distance to other elements </br> one example is margin-bottom: 10px; as this will push the element under 10px away</p>

        <h3>Adjusting to fit the element to the picture</h3>
        <p>By this i mean: if originally having an width:200px; and height:80px; </br> then by adding additional modifiers as padding, border or margins will change the size and position </br>
        So if wanting to get it back to how it were, WITH the additional modifiers. </br> you will have to substract the added modifiers from the value you want to adjust. </br>
    wherever it is the width, height or both</p>

    <h2>Text-align</h2>
    <p>Text-align defines the horizontal positioning of a text, within an element </br> it got 4 elements to it, and will stay in its position as you zoom in or out </br>
    {text-align: center;} will make the text go to the center </br> {text-align: left;} or {text-align: right;} will do as it say </br> {text-align: justify;} im not sure about yet</p>

    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <p>Simply explained, it defines the style of an html element. With different modifiers, explained below</p>

    <h3>List-style-type</h3>
    <p>This will define which icon or mark that will appear Before the list text/links (Style or type) </br> while there are many MANY types out there, these are the most common used ones </br>
    ol.a or ul.a {List-style-type: ......;}  Square, circle, disc, decimal (tall), and none;}  </br> the latter one is not wanting anything infront of the list</p>
